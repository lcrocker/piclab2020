Floating point numbers in the range (0,1) are represented as strings in the 
following way:

1.0 is represented as "#"

Numbers in the interval [0, 1) are first converted to an integer which is
the numerator of the fraction with the denominator 8388608 (2 ** 23), then
encoded in base64 (1 to 4 digits). So the possible values are:

"0" == 0
"1" == 1/8388608
"2" == 2/8388608
...
"V///" = 8388607/8388608
